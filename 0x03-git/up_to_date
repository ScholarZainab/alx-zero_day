# Git Command Line Used for Updating README.md
To update my README.md file with the latest changes from the main branch, I followed these steps:
1. Ensure I am on the main branch: git checkout main
2. Pull the latest changes from the remote main branch: git pull origin main
3. Opened my README.md file in a text editor and made necessary updates.
4. Saved the changes: git add .
5. Commited the changes: git commit -m 'your commit message'.
6. Optional: Push the changes to the remote repository: git push origin main
These steps helped me keep my README.md file up-to-date with the latest changes in the main branch.
